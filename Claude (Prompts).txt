Claude (Prompts):


1) CREATE CONNECTION

I want to create a PostgreSQL connection in my Sync instance
It should be named as PostgreSQL-Alex
The name of the provider is CData PostgreSQL
That PostgreSQL listens on port 5432, server is 54.227.140.238, user is "postgres", password "presales", database "presales"



2) DELETE CONNECTION

Can you delete the connection that you just created?
